## 🛒 E-Commerce Spending Prediction

This project uses **Linear Regression** to predict customer spending on an e-commerce platform based on user behavior data.

### 📊 Project Overview

Using a dataset with features like:
- Time spent on the website
- Time spent on the mobile app
- Length of membership
- Session length

We train a **Linear Regression model** to estimate the **annual amount a customer might spend**. This can help businesses understand which factors influence spending and where to focus their improvement efforts.

### 🧠 What’s Included

- Data exploration and cleaning
- Visualizations with Seaborn and Matplotlib
- Model training using scikit-learn
- Performance evaluation using:
  - R² Score
  - MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
  - MSE (Mean Squared Error)
  - RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)

### ⚙️ Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

### 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ecommerce-linear-regression.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the notebook or script:
